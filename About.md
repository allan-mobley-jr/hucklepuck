## About the Arthur

I'm a full-stack developer and currently lead engineer 
at QBCart, an enterprise SaaS application hosted in Azure.

My language of choice is **C#**, but I'm certainly no stranger 
to client-side technologies, such as **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

I have plenty of hands on experience with **REST** APIs 
and working with both **JSON** and **XML**.

Relational databases and NoSQL ones don't scare me either,
as I have used both here at QBCart: **Azure SQL** and **Azure Cosmos**.

Version controls (**git** and **GitHub**) and CI/CD pipelines (**Azure Pipelines**), 
do I love thee!

Finally, as a highly driven developer, I'm am constantly 
keeping abreast of moves in software technologies and tools.
It's the reason why we are taking this serverless journey in the first place.
